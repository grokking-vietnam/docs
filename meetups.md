[The absolute minimum every software developer needs to know about database indexes](https://speakerdeck.com/ejamesc/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-needs-to-know-about-database-indexes)

**Cedric Chin** (Floating Cube Studios, Ho Chi Minh City)

> If you’re a software developer, it’s nearly guaranteed that you’ve worked with a database before. But what happens when you find your queries running slowly? How do you debug bad database performance? The truth is, most of us don’t know much about RDMS internals: we just insert and retrieve data and pray that our queries run quickly enough.
>
> The good news? It turns out that the only thing a developer really needs to understand about relational databases is how their indexes work. Most of the performance characteristics of modern RDMSes may be explained through the database index. This talk introduces the data structures these indexes use, how these structures determine query performance, how to read a query plan, and what to think about when designing indexes for your database schema.

##### [How we built our data-warehouse and analytics infrastructure at Viki](http://www.slideshare.net/nvquanghuy/grokking-engineering-data-analytics-infrastructure-at-viki-huy-nguyen)

**Huy Nguyen** (Viki, Singapore)

> At Viki we collect and analyze over 60M user-generated data points everyday. This talk goes into deep technical and architecture design to share about the infrastructure, the different tools and processes we’ve built with our analytics system. Specifically we’ll talk about how we collect, process data and present data in both real-time and batch-processing manners.
>
> The current system is capable of supporting a variety of business and product needs: automated business reporting, A/B testing, cohort analysis, funnel analysis, recommendation engine, etc.
>
> Technology stack: Ruby, Python, R, NodeJS, Golang, PostgreSQL, Java, Storm, Hadoop with Apache Hive.
