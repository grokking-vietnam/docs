Here are some community rules you should follow:

- Be nice. Ask nicely and don't forget to say thank you.
- Don't discuss about sensitive topics: politics, religion, sex...
- Use **@channel** or **@here** wisely. No one wants to be disturbed unnecessarily.
- Avoid **@channel** or **@here** in **#general-discussions**. The rest are fine.
- If you have any concerns or feedback, talk to admins at **#feedback**
